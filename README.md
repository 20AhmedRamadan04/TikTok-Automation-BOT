Extraction of profile data, including followers count and coin balance.

Management of successful and failed account logins.

Prerequisites

Required Software

Python 3.x: Make sure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed.

Google Chrome: The bot uses Chrome for automation.

ChromeDriver: Ensure ChromeDriver matches your Chrome version. You can download it from here: https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/.

Required Python Modules

Install the required dependencies using pip:
pip install required_module_name
Modules included:

selenium

undetected-chromedriver

beautifulsoup4

phonenumbers

Setup

1. Prepare data.txt

Create a file named data.txt in the project directory. Add your accounts in the format:
+1234567890:password123
Each line represents an account with a phone number or email and password.

2. CAPTCHA API Key

The script uses a CAPTCHA-solving API. Replace the placeholder in the script with your API key:
self.api_key = 'YOUR_CAPTCHA_API_KEY'  # Replace with your API key
3. Configuration

Ensure ChromeDriver is in your PATH or provide the path in the script.

Usage

To run the script, use the following command:
python main.py
The bot will:

Read accounts from data.txt.

Attempt to log in to each account.

Extract profile data (username, followers, coins) for successful logins.

Save results to result.txt and failed logins to corrupted_accounts.txt.

Files Created During Execution

result.txt: Stores data for successful logins.

corrupted_accounts.txt: Stores credentials of accounts that failed to log in.

Notes

Ensure data.txt contains valid credentials.

Use a secure CAPTCHA API service and keep your API key private.
